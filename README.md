# quantum_computation
Development of a Quantum programming suite using only Python and NumPy

As an exercise, I am building a basic quantum circuits/algorithms language from scratch.
Of course, this is a classical simulator.  

This is code base is in its infancy.  I am still hashing out architectural decisions about how to implement basic quantum features.  Hopefully more soon to come!
